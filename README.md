This is my week4 project for "Components of Tidy Data"

The Codebook can be found in Codebook.md

The run_analysis.R file will run all required data. It assumes that the plyr package is installed.

Data used come from:

[1] Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012
